# DineInsight: Restaurant Demand & User Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
New York’s food delivery ecosystem is rapidly growing, with professionals and students heavily relying on online platforms to order from their favorite restaurants. As the number of restaurants increases, understanding user preferences and restaurant demand becomes crucial for improving customer experience and business performance.

This project analyzes user and restaurant data from an online food delivery platform to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights that help enhance operational efficiency and user satisfaction.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
With the rising number of restaurants in New York, customers are increasingly turning to food delivery apps for convenience. Once an order is placed, a delivery partner is assigned, picks up the food, and delivers it to the customer—after which the user rates the service. The company earns revenue by collecting a fixed margin from restaurant partners.

To improve the platform’s effectiveness and user satisfaction, the company wants to identify which restaurants are preferred, how customers behave on the platform, and what operational improvements can be made using data-driven insights.
